# TMSi SAGA #

This repository contains code for the MATLAB and Python APIs compatible with Windows 10 v2.0.0 drivers and beyond for use with the TMSi SAGA data recorder.
Note that the MATLAB files at the top-level are modified from the original TMSiSAGA Matlab package supplied by TMSi, which is in the MATLAB folder. These files are custom versions that can be used directly if this repository is added as a submodule to a workspace with the name `+TMSiSAGA`.
